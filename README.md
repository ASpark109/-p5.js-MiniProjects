The field generates points with random coordinates and velocities along the X and Y axes, if the distance between the points is less than the lineDist, a line is drawn between the points. The thickness of the line depends on the distance between the two points.

Gravity simulation, each ball has its own weight, elasticity, and initial velocity. If the ball touches the wall, it changes the direction of its movement, and its speed decreases according to the coefficient of elasticity.
